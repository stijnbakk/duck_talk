/**
 * One phone connection, wired end to end: ears hear, Claude answers, voice reads the
 * answer back, and every reply byte goes to the phone.
 *
 * The state is who holds the floor, and there are only three answers:
 *
 *   user ──final transcript──▶ claude ──voice drained──▶ user
 *     ├──(review)──▶ held ──yes/edit──▶ claude      claude ──new utterance──▶ user (barge-in)
 *     └──typed─────────────▶ claude                 claude ──continuation──▶ user (retract)
 *
 * A finished transcript means something different in each, which is why there are
 * exactly three: the instruction, the answer to a held question, or — because a
 * partial has already cancelled the turn — the instruction that replaces it. Speech
 * during a turn splits on the ears' own JOIN decision: a new utterance is a barge-in
 * and cancels, a continuation is the instruction still being spoken and takes the
 * turn back to run again whole — see `retract`. A typed instruction has none of that
 * ambiguity: it cannot have been misheard, so it is never corrected and never held,
 * and it runs the moment it arrives.
 *
 * Audio in is what buys audio out. The ears open on the first microphone buffer rather
 * than on connect, and the voice speaks only for a connection that has ears — so a
 * connection that is only typed to never opens a Gemini session in either direction,
 * and nothing has to be told which kind of connection it is.
 *
 * A picture — or a pasted text — is neither spoken nor typed: it is picked before there
 * is an instruction to give it with, so it is held on the turn rather than carried by the
 * frame that starts one. That is what makes typed, spoken and approved-in-review a single
 * path — and what makes a retract free, since the turn it re-runs still holds them. See
 * `attached`.
 *
 * ears is a long-lived session for the connection and claude one for the *chat* —
 * claimed on open, released on close, and still working after the socket is gone —
 * so an interrupt cancels a turn and leaves both warm; the next one is fast. The
 * voice is not a session at all — one request per sentence — so there is nothing
 * there for an interrupt to damage and nothing to reopen when one fails.
