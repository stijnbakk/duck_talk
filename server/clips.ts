/**
 * The audio of one utterance, exactly as the ears heard it.
 *
 * A clip is the slice of microphone stream that produced one transcript — same bytes,
 * same order, nothing resampled. That is the whole point: a correction made against a
 * remembered sentence is a guess, and a correction made while listening to what was
 * actually sent is evidence. The phone plays these; `corrections.ts` points at them.
 *
 * A clip's id is the moment the utterance finished — unique, orderable, and the same
 * number the turn record and any correction born from it carry. So the id is also the
 * filename, and nothing has to keep an index.
 *
 * How long one lives is one rule: a clip a correction points at is part of that
 * correction and stays; every other clip lives a week. The whole correction store is
 * asked, not the window a prompt gets — see `load` in corrections.ts.
 *
 * Written as a WAV rather than raw PCM because the one consumer is a phone that plays
 * it: 44 bytes of header is what turns "some bytes" into something AVAudioPlayer opens
 * with no format agreed anywhere.
