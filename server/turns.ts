/**
 * What every turn did and when — the relay's own record of its work.
 *
 * One line of JSON per finished turn, in `.duck-talk/turns.jsonl`. The phone, this
 * relay and the test harness all run on one Mac, so every stamp here shares one clock
 * and any latency is a subtraction rather than a measurement. `app/sim.py` reads this
 * file to report what a spoken turn cost.
 *
 * It is also, without anything being added for it, the index from a past conversation
 * back to its audio: a turn holds the `instruction` Claude was sent — verbatim what
 * the transcript shows — beside the `clip` it was heard from. So `chats.ts` can put a
 * play button on a line you spoke last week, and nothing had to be written twice.
 *
 * `session.ts` fills a Turn in as it goes and appends it here; this file is where the
 * shape lives, so that the thing that writes the log and the thing that reads it agree
 * without either owning the other.
