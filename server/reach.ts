/**
 * Every address a phone can reach this relay at, said by the one process that knows.
 *
 * Three rows, for the three places a phone can be. The relay bound the socket, so it
 * knows the port; the Mac's own interfaces say what the LAN calls it; and Tailscale,
 * when it is set up, keeps a record of the front door it holds open — read here, and
 * repointed only when it leads nowhere. Nothing else has to guess an address, which is
 * what let `dt` and the app each carry one and disagree.
 *
 *   simulator    the app running on this Mac
 *   same Wi-Fi   a phone on the same network, plain ws:// to a private address
 *   anywhere     a phone on cellular, which needs a tunnel — and needs wss://, because
 *                iOS refuses cleartext to anything that is not a private address
 *
 * The third row is Tailscale because it is the one tunnel that needs no third party
 * and hands out a real certificate: `tailscale serve --bg 8765`, once, and the phone
 * dials `wss://<mac>.<tailnet>.ts.net` — with no port in it, because the front door is
 * 443 and forwards to 8765 on its own. That last fact is why the port is fixed: a
 * relay that stepped to 8766 would still be behind a door that opens onto 8765.
 *
 * Which is where the one write comes in. A door onto a port where something is
 * listening belongs to whatever is behind it, and is reported and left alone. A door
 * onto a port where nothing is listening belongs to nobody — taking it cannot steal a
 * phone from anyone, because no phone is reaching anything through it — so this
 * repoints it at the running relay and says so. Without that, a `wss://` address
 * resolves, presents a valid certificate, and answers nothing, which is the one
 * failure a phone on cellular cannot tell apart from a bad Wi-Fi day.
