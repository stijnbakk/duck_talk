/**
 * A Gemini Live session used as nothing but ears: audio in, text out.
 *
 * This used to be an agent — it transcribed, then decided, then emitted a `converse`
 * function call. Measured against plain transcription on 15 phrases it lost on every
 * axis: five times the word errors ("what branch am I on" came back as "What brand
 * Jimmy on?"), first text on screen twice as late, and the function call itself cost
 * ~1.6s, because the transcript was complete at ~674ms but the call did not arrive
 * until ~2260ms. So the deciding is gone and the transcript is the instruction.
 *
 * Two signals, and the model draws the line between them itself:
 *   onPartial  the whole utterance as currently understood, revised as you speak
 *   onFinal    that utterance, finished — the only flush signal there is
 *
 * `onPartial` carries the full text every time, not a delta, because a hypothesis
 * revises itself ("what is the letter" → "what is the latest"). Callers replace
 * rather than append.
 *
 * The line is drawn by silence, and it is drawn fast — see SILENCE_MS — so a pause
 * for thought inside a sentence ends it early. A final that comes soon enough after
 * the last one is therefore the rest of that sentence, and is stitched back onto it
 * here: a final is always a whole utterance, and the caller never sees the seam.
 *
 * A final also carries the audio it was made from. Every byte went out through this
 * file, and 16 kHz Int16 is 32 bytes per millisecond, so where an utterance began and
 * ended in the stream is a subtraction rather than a measurement — the same trick the
 * turn timings use. The model has no word timestamps to offer here — the SDK's
 * `wordTimestamp: true` sits exactly where `customVocabulary` goes, and
 * `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live` returns finals without a `words` field either way
 * (probed raw, flag on) — so the two transcript signals are the clock: the first
 * partial says speech had started, the final says it has stopped.
 *
 *   node ears.ts --file turn.wav      feed a 16 kHz mono recording, print events

// not a constant's. Derived, not chosen, from both ends of the window: the reply's first
// sound reaches the listener no sooner than ~2.4s after a final (Claude ≥1s warm,
// sentence buffer, voice ~0.75s, from the turn log), so speech heard to *start*
// before then cannot be an answer to anything — and "heard to start" runs late,
// because the first partial commits 0.2–1.8s after speech resumes (the same spread
// MAX_LEAD_MS exists for). At 2000 that lag pushed real continuations over the line;
// 3000 covers the lag and still ends before a reply can have been heard and reacted
// to. A longer pause is not joined; the tail reaches Claude on its own, and Claude's
