/**
 * Voice relay: one WebSocket per phone, one Session behind it (ears + Claude + voice).
 *
 * Started by `cli.ts` in whatever folder you are standing in, and that folder is the
 * whole of the configuration — it is what Claude works in, so it decides which chats
 * exist, and it is where everything the relay learns is kept. See paths.ts.
 *
 *   ↑ binary  raw PCM Int16 LE, 16 kHz, mono          (mic)
 *   ↑ text    {"type":"text","text"}                  an instruction, typed — over a reply, a barge-in
 *             {"type":"mark","name","at"?,"note"?}    a moment only the phone can see
 *             {"type":"played","ms"}                  reply audio its speaker has played
 *             {"type":"approve","text"?}              run a held instruction, as edited
 *             {"type":"stop"}                         stop everything in this chat: the turn and its background tasks
 *             {"type":"attach","id","data"|"text"}     a picture (base64 JPEG) or a pasted text, for the next instruction
 *             {"type":"claude","model"?,"permission"?,"effort"?} which model answers, what it may do, how hard it thinks
 *   ↓ binary  raw PCM Int16 LE, 24 kHz, mono          (Claude's voice)
 *   ↓ text    {"type":"user"|"model"|"tool"|"approval"|"turn_start"|"interrupted"|"turn_end"|"error","text"?}
 *             a `turn_start` is the instruction reaching Claude — the turn is running
 *             a `user` event also carries `partial`: true replaces the line, false ends it
 *             a `turn_end` carries `session`: which chat this connection is in — and `user`
 *               and `model`: where the turn's two messages sit in the store ({uuid, after?}),
 *               so a line just said can be forked or edited without reopening the chat
 *             a finished `user` carries `clip`: that utterance's audio, by id
 *             a `tool` carries `parent`: the Agent call it ran inside, null for Claude's own
 *             an `interrupted` may carry `retract`: the turn was taken back, un-show it
 *
 * Audio is what buys audio: the ears open on the first microphone buffer and the voice
 * speaks only where there are ears, so a connection that is only typed to reaches
 * Claude and never Gemini — with nothing in the URL saying which kind it is.
 *
 * A session is in one `?mode=`: `direct` (default) runs each instruction at once,
 * `review` holds it for a yes/no/edit first. Orthogonal to both, `?correct=1` has a
 * fast text model fix the instruction first, from the pairs a review-mode edit
 * taught (`.duck-talk/corrections.jsonl`). `?readback=1` also reads a held instruction aloud,
 * for deciding without looking at the screen. `?resume=<id>` carries on a past chat
 * instead of starting one — any session Claude Code has in this project, including
 * the ones you started in a terminal. A resumed chat whose Claude session is still
 * working is *attached to* rather than reopened — see claude.ts — and the running
 * turn streams down the new socket from that moment on; what came before is in the
 * transcript the phone loaded. So a connection opened with `?resume=` and nothing to
 * send is how the phone watches a working chat: `turn_start`, then the same events
 * as any turn, ending in `turn_end`.
 *
 * Which model answers, what it is allowed to do and how hard it thinks are deliberately
 * not in the URL: the CLI takes all three mid-session, so they arrive as a `claude`
 * frame whenever the phone opens a socket or changes its mind, and hold from the next
 * turn. Nothing reconnects to think differently.
 *
 * `?data=1` is a connection that reads and edits what the relay can see and nothing
 * else — the corrections, the prompts it says to each model, the models themselves, the
 * project's skills, and the chats — so the phone can show those screens with no voice
 * session running. It opens with `relay`: the package version, which is also the app's
 * version (both read package.json), so the phone can put the two side by side. Every
 * message after that is answered with all of the state, so the phone never has to ask
 * twice or guess what the files now say. The exceptions are the two parts that are not small: one chat's messages, sent
 * when asked for by `chat_open`, and the media, sent as a binary frame when asked for
 * by `clip_get` or `image_get` — the only binary a data connection ever carries, and one
 * question gets one frame, so there is nothing to tell apart. `fork` branches a chat at one message and answers
 * with the new one, which is `chat_open` on it; `chat_star`, `chat_rename` and
 * `chat_delete` answer with nothing of their own, because the list already says.
 * Each chat in the list carries `working`: Claude has work in flight there — a turn
 * being answered, or a background task still going. It is the one fact the store on
 * disk cannot say, and it changes on its own, so a fresh list is also pushed to every
 * open data connection the moment it does — see live.ts.
 *
 * Every finished turn is appended to `.duck-talk/turns.jsonl`. The phone, this relay and the
 * test harness all run on one Mac, so those timestamps share one clock and any
 * latency is a subtraction, never a measurement.
