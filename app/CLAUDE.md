# app/ — Duck Talk iOS client

SwiftUI, iOS 17+, no external Swift packages, one target. The home screen is the
conversation — one socket to `server/` per chat on screen, with the microphone as
something that flows on it rather than a different connection — and past chats behind
the drawer on the left. A running session is a CallKit call, which is what puts it on the
lock screen and lets AirPods stem presses reach it (`Call.swift`).

The bar under the composer splits at the microphone: what you are adding to the turn on
the left (`+`, then the model), the session itself on the right (Direct/Review until it
starts, then mute, output and stop). The left two stay usable while live, because the relay puts
what it carries on the session already running. `Choices.swift` holds the choices and the
one sheet that shows them; the model list comes down the socket rather than being written
into the app, and effort — how hard the model thinks — is a row inside the model sheet,
its levels read off each model's own row in that list.

`+` is `ContextSheet.swift`: the camera, the last dozen photos straight from PhotoKit, All
photos for the rest, and Permission — which lives there rather than in the bar because you
glance at the model every turn and set the permission once. A picture is held on the turn
rather than carried by the frame that starts one (`Attachment.swift`, `VoiceSession.attached`),
so typing, talking and approving are one path and a retract keeps them. A line just sent
draws the bytes it still has; a chat reopened later draws by id over `image_get`. A paste
over 800 characters leaves the field and rides the same holder as a TXT chip: it reaches
Claude whole as a `document` block, the way Claude.ai sends one, and comes back with the
chat inline as `pastes` — the transcript is its only store.

What the ears are hearing is drawn as your bubble in the transcript, dimmed until the
relay has run it; the field holds only text that waits for your arrow — a draft, or an
instruction held for review. Typing and talking are frames on the same socket (`VoiceSession.swift`). The relay opens
ears only once audio arrives and closes them when it stops, so a typed turn costs no
Gemini session and gets no spoken reply, and tapping the mic mid-turn joins the turn
rather than starting a chat beside it. Typing mid-turn barges in — the relay drops the
reply, runs the typed line, and reads the answer aloud if the mic is open — so the field
stays yours while live and sending never stops the microphone. The socket is held while there is a reason to —
the mic is open, a turn this screen sent is running, or the relay says the chat is
working — and closes otherwise; the relay keeps the chat's work going without it. Typing
`/` offers the project's skills, filtered on-device from the list the data socket already
holds; sending `/name` runs one, because the CLI expands it into the turn itself. The
earlier chat client (session list, SSE against the web app's Express backend, now at the
`web-app` tag) is parked on the `ios/wired-mvp` branch; pull pieces over from there
rather than rewriting them.

One thing the phone does that the simulator cannot show you: `UIBackgroundModes: audio`
and `voip` keep the microphone and the call alive once the screen locks — iOS will not
let a backgrounded app *start* recording, so a session always begins in the foreground.

## Working loop — the `ios-sim` MCP

The MCP is an HTTP server you start yourself — `./dt mcp` — and `.mcp.json` points at
its URL. Nothing spawns it, so if the tools are missing it isn't running. It reloads
on every edit to `sim.py`, so a new tool is live on the next call without restarting
Claude Code.

`run()` is the whole loop: it builds, installs, launches, and returns a screenshot —
or the compiler's errors, or the log tail if the app died. Then `tap(label="…")`,
`swipe`, and `type_text` drive the app, each returning the screen it produced.

`type_text` pastes; it does not type. Keystrokes arrive as whatever the simulator's
keyboard layout and autocorrect make of them — "what is two plus two" landed as "Abat os
tao plus tzo" — and the pasteboard has neither. It appends at the cursor, because Cmd+A
on this simulator sends the app to the home screen; tap into an empty field.

Never claim a UI change works off a successful compile — `run()` hands you the
screen, so look at it.

Coordinates are **points** (402×874 on an iPhone 17 Pro), and screenshots are scaled
to exactly that, so a coordinate read off an image goes straight back into `tap`. No
conversion anywhere. `tap(label="Accept")` matches accessibility labels and needs no
coordinates at all — prefer it; the listen button is `tap(id="listen")`. There is no `ui` tool: the screenshot shows what's on
screen, and `exec_code` has `ax_tree()` if you ever need the raw tree.

## Voice turns

`play_audio(text="what is two plus two")` speaks to the app as a user would, then
reports what the turn actually did, plus a screenshot:

```
{"latency_ms": 8381, "claude_ms": 6146, "buffer_ms": 30, "tts_ms": 890, "to_phone_ms": 1,
 "voice_ms": 5630, "cost_usd": 0.063,
 "heard": "What time is it?", "said": "It's 8:45 AM, Friday August 28th."}
```

Injection is a black box and the result is not. `say` plays into `BlackHole 2ch`, the
device the app listens to, so the question goes through the real microphone path. But
nothing is measured from sound: the relay writes every finished turn to
`turns.jsonl` under the state directory of whatever folder it was started in — this
repo, so `.duck-talk/turns.jsonl` — and the app reports over the same socket the
moment the first reply byte reached it.

That works because **the app, the relay and this harness all run on this Mac, so they
share one clock.** Every number is a subtraction between two timestamps. Nothing is
thresholded, calibrated, or detected — there is no signal processing left to be wrong.

`latency_ms` is the question finishing → the relay sending the first reply byte:
Gemini routing, Claude thinking, TTS, and both network legs — the whole wait, now
dominated by Claude, not Gemini. `claude_ms` is Claude's slice of it (cold on turn
one, then resumed and fast). `buffer_ms` and `tts_ms` split what used to be one
number: text waiting for a sentence boundary, then the voice model's own latency —
so a slow reply says which of the two to go after. `to_phone_ms` is that byte reaching the phone — the cost
of relaying through the Mac, the number Architecture B lives or dies on; it measures
~1 ms. `voice_ms` is exact: 24 kHz Int16 is 48 bytes per millisecond. `cost_usd` is
what the Claude turn cost.

Only the microphone is ours. The reply plays out of whatever output the Mac already
uses, so you can hear turns happen and no second virtual device has to be working.
Needs `brew install --cask blackhole-2ch`.

An audio session is built at launch from the devices the Mac has then, and a change
afterwards breaks it — every Connect fails with "microphone format can't be
converted". So `run()` sets the microphone *before* the simulator boots, and
`play_audio` only checks it and connects the app if it isn't already. Two calls, no
retry dance: `run()`, then `play_audio(...)`.

Anything else that moves CoreAudio under a booted simulator — switching devices by
hand, `killall coreaudiod`, a sleep — breaks its sessions the same way, and there is
no way to see it coming. So `play_audio` recovers instead of predicting: if Connect
fails it restarts the simulator once and tries again, and only then gives up, quoting
the red line the app is showing rather than guessing at a cause.

For the Mac half alone, with no simulator and no audio devices: `node server/probe.ts
"what is two plus two"` returns what Gemini heard and said in about a second.

Same machinery from a terminal, for humans:

```bash
cd app
./dt run            # build, boot sim, install, launch
./dt build          # compile only; prints just errors and warnings
./dt shot           # screenshot -> .build/shot.png
./dt logs 10        # app logs for 10s
./dt udid           # target simulator, booting it if needed
./dt phone          # build signed, install and launch on the iPhone on the cable
./dt mcp            # serve the ios-sim MCP over HTTP, reloading on every edit
```

`./dt phone` needs a signing team in `app/.team` (gitignored) and a phone that is
paired with Developer Mode on. The address to paste under gear ▸ Server is on the
relay's own startup lines — `same Wi-Fi` for a phone on your network, `anywhere` for
Tailscale's `wss://…ts.net`, which reaches the Mac from cellular and carries a
certificate iOS accepts. A LAN `ws://` address works because `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`
covers private addresses — a public `ws://` is refused, so off Wi-Fi it is `wss://` or
nothing. The Server sheet checks the address as you type. README › Your iPhone has the
three Tailscale steps.

Override the simulator with `SIM="iPhone 17" ./dt run` (`sim.py` follows it).

`dt` owns the lifecycle, `sim.py` exposes it to the model and adds input via `axe`
(`brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe`). Neither duplicates the other — extend the one
whose job it is.

## Project files

`DuckTalk.xcodeproj` is **generated** and gitignored. Edit `project.yml` and
re-run `./dt gen`. The same step writes `buildServer.json` (also gitignored, absolute
paths) so SourceKit-LSP reads the generated project instead of compiling each file
alone for macOS — which is what "Cannot find 'Brand' in scope" in an editor means:
run `./dt gen`, or `brew install xcode-build-server` if it is not on the machine.

Sources are globbed from `DuckTalk/` and `Shared/`, so a new `.swift` file needs no
project edit. Never hand-edit `.pbxproj`.

The brand is in `Shared/`: `Brand.swift` for the palette, `Brand.xcassets` for the mark
(`Image("Logo")`) and the `AccentColor` the system tints with. `scripts/app-icon.sh` writes that mark and
the app icon from the one drawing in `assets/`, so neither is edited by hand — and
`scripts/filler-sound.py` writes `DuckTalk/Resources/pad.wav`, the loop the app
plays while a reply is owed, the same way: synthesized from numbers, never edited.

Adding an SPM dependency means editing `project.yml` — ask first, the app is
deliberately dependency-free.
