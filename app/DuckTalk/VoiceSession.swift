/// One conversation with Claude, on one socket, reached by talking or by typing.
///
///   socket  ?resume=<chat> ──▶ relay ──▶ the chat's Claude session
///     typing    a text frame on it
///     talking   mic → AudioPipe → binary frames on it; reply PCM → AudioPipe
///     watching  just being connected — a working chat streams its turn as it goes
///
/// There is one socket because there is one chat on screen. What varies is whether
/// audio is flowing on it: the relay opens its ears on the first microphone buffer and
/// closes them when the buffers stop, so talking is a property of the connection rather
/// than a different connection. Switching from typing to talking, or coming back to a
/// chat mid-turn, is therefore not a switch at all.
///
/// The socket is held while there is a reason to — `wantSocket`: the microphone is
/// open, a turn this screen sent is in flight, or the relay says the chat is working.
/// When none is true it closes, and the relay keeps the chat's work going without it.
///
/// `chatId` is what makes every socket land in the same conversation. The relay names
/// the chat at `turn_start`, so even the first turn of a new chat has an id before it is
/// over, and a microphone opened in the middle of it resumes it rather than starting one.
///
/// What Claude *is* — model, permission, effort — and the pictures for the next
/// instruction ride the socket as frames, sent when it opens and when they change.
///
/// What you are saying and what has been said are kept apart, because the screen keeps
/// them apart: `utterance` is the sentence being transcribed right now, and `lines` is
/// everything already sent. An utterance joins `lines` when the relay shows it was
/// actually sent, so nothing appears in the history that never ran.
